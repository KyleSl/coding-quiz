## Coding quiz

# Goal

The goal of this project was to make a quiz about coding.
The criteria was to have a start button for the quiz that would initiate a timer and present the user with questions.
Although there was no criteria about user feedback, a response of "correct" or "incorrect" was added.

# Functionality

The user loads the page and is presented with a very minimal layout, with only a "start" button and a few things in the header.
Once the start button is pressed, a timer in the top right counts down from 60 and the quiz goes through 13 questions.
The raw question data can be found in the script.js. The answers to the questions are randomly presented. I did this to ensure that no one could cheese the quiz by always pressing the first answer (I designed my code to always have the first answer correct).
When the quiz is over, the user is presented with previous scores and a way to submit their score. The user is supposed to only enter initials in that field but I was too lazy to do validation for it.

# Conclusion

This was a fun javascript task and it feels pretty great to make my first (really) functional thing. I can send the link to my friends and they can play my quiz. Most other projects I have made have required them to have compilers or some other way to view it.
